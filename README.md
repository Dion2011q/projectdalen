# 🏘️ Dalen in GeoCraft

This is the official website project for **Dalen in GeoCraft** — a 1:1 scale recreation of the town of Dalen (Drenthe, NL) in the GeoCraft Minecraft server.

## 🌍 About the Project

GeoCraft is a unique Minecraft server where players recreate the Netherlands at a 1:1 scale.  
This specific project focuses on **Dalen**, a village located in Drenthe, which I'm building with friends as accurately as possible using real maps and references.

The website serves as a hub for progress updates, screenshots, maps, and fun insights into the town and the build process.
